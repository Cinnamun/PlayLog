# PlayLog
Profile display for your Spotify account: Check out your top tracks and artists of the month, along with your recently played songs! Developed the frontend using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and utilized Flask for the backend with PostgreSQL as the database.

This web app needs approval from Spotify to transition from development mode to extended quota mode. Until then, users will not be able to access the app unless I directly add the user to the permissions list.
